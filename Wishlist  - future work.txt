Things I want to improve:

1) Cleaning up extraneous comments and test-lines
2) Getting the shuffle function to not repeat entries... I've gotten close, but 
   run into problems of circulity (i.e. a recursive function pinging so many times
   that I exceed my ping limit with only 4 cards in the library...)
3) Setting a collection of different "decks" to pull from, based on topic (i.e. 
   'History", "Cinema/TV Facts", "Scientific Facts," etc)
